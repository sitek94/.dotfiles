# Warp Launch Configuration
#
#
# Use this to start a certain configuration of windows, tabs, and panes
# Open the launch configuration palette to access and open any launch configuration
#
# This file defines your launch configuration
# More on how to do so here:
# https://docs.warp.dev/features/session-management/launch-configurations
#
# All launch configurations are stored under ~/.warp/launch_configurations/
# Edit them anytime!
#
# You can also add commands that run on-start for your launch configurations like so:
# ---
# name: Example with Command
# windows:
#  - tabs:
#      - layout:
#          cwd: /Users/warp-user/project
#          commands:
